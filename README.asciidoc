ConvertUnit README
==================

ConvertUnit is a demo program that does simple scale unit conversions 
on mobile devices.  The source is written in mobl 
(http://www.mobl-lang.org/)

ConvertUnit is a simple unit conversion program written in mobl.
To do a conversion, simply type in the value and units.  For example,
to convert 34 centimeters, type in '34cm'.  The various common conversions
will be displayed.  Several variants are acceptable for the units (ex, 
34cm, 34 cm, 34 centimeter).  Note that mobl is fantastic in that you
don't need to press go, it works as you type.

This software is designed to give common conversions with minimal inputs
by the user.  Type and the conversions appear.  It does lack generality,
but who needs to know how many inches are in a light year?
